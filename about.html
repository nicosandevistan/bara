    <h2>About BARA</h2>
    <p>
      BARA was created to close the gap between genetic design and functionality prediction. We aim to empower young scientists and underfunded teams with the ability to test ideas in silico.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our vision is to democratize synthetic biology. We believe access to design tools shouldn't be limited to well-funded labs — everyone, from high school students to independent biohackers, should have a way to test and refine their ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      BARA is built for those on the frontier — young researchers, DIY bio enthusiasts, and early-stage synthetic biologists looking to move fast with limited resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      We're just getting started. In the future, BARA will allow users to describe what they want a cell to do — and receive ready-to-build circuits in response. If you're excited about building that future, follow along or reach out with your ideas.
